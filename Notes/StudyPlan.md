Based on the project requirements and your background, here's a study plan to help you approach this linear regression project:
Study Plan:

Refresher on sum of squared errors and fitting a line to a dataset

Concept: Understand how to measure the difference between predicted and actual values
Application: See how this is used to find the best-fitting line


Start with the Training Program

Understand the dataset (data.csv)

Familiarize yourself with the format and the meaning of each column


Learn about the hypothesis function (estimatePrice)

Understand how theta0 and theta1 relate to the hypothesis


Implement the cost function

Use the formulas provided for tmpθ0 and tmpθ1
Understand the role of the learning rate


Implement gradient descent

Learn how to update theta0 and theta1 simultaneously
Determine the number of iterations and learning rate


Train the model and save theta0 and theta1


Move on to the Prediction Program

Load the saved theta0 and theta1 values
Implement the estimatePrice function
Prompt the user for mileage input
Calculate and display the estimated price


Bonus:

Plot the data points and the regression line
Implement a program to calculate the precision of your algorithm



Remember, take your time to understand each concept before moving on to the next. Don't hesitate to ask questions or seek clarification whenever needed.
To start, let's review the concept of sum of squared errors and how it relates to finding the best-fitting line.
