θ0 (theta0):

θ0 represents the y-intercept of the best-fitting line.
In the hypothesis function hθ(x) = θ0 + θ1 * x, θ0 is the value of y when x is zero.
It is the point where the line crosses the y-axis.
Also called the bias term or the offset.


θ1 (theta1):

θ1 represents the slope of the best-fitting line.
In the hypothesis function hθ(x) = θ0 + θ1 * x, θ1 determines how much y changes for a unit increase in x.
It indicates the steepness and direction of the line.
A positive θ1 means the line slopes upward, while a negative θ1 means the line slopes downward.

Role of the Learning Rate:
The learning rate, often denoted as α (alpha), is a hyperparameter that determines the step size at which the parameters (theta0 and theta1) are updated during gradient descent. It controls how much the parameters are adjusted in each iteration based on the gradient of the cost function.

If the learning rate is too small, the algorithm will take many iterations to converge, resulting in a slow learning process.
If the learning rate is too large, the algorithm may overshoot the minimum and fail to converge, or even diverge.
